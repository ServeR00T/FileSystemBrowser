# FileSystemBrowser

just an algorithm and data structure course project.

### Idea

The main purpose of the project to use an existing or create a new abstact data structure, so we [Bassam & I] thought its useless to use an existing data structure so we created something between Linked List and Binary Tree as bassam called it "Hybrid" :D

The upper part shows the Link object (Node of the LinkNet) and it has:

- *parent* : points the the parent Link
- *previous* : points the the previous Link
- *next* : points the the next Link
- *firstSubFolder* : points the the first Link of serial subfolders (assume it as a Linked List but it isn't)
- *firstSubFile* : points the the first Link of serial subfiles

The lower part an example shows how it binds together
